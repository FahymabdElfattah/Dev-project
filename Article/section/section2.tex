
\subsection*{Conclusion}
The Configurable and Reversible Imaging Pipeline (CRIP) that proposed in the article "Reconfiguring the Imaging Pipeline for Computer Vision" and the pruning algorithm are distinct yet complementary concepts in the field of imaging and data processing. The CRIP enables the configuration and optimization of the image processing pipeline, while the pruning algorithm reduces the complexity of the models used in the pipeline. They can be used together to customize the pipeline and optimize performance while reducing model size and accelerating computations.
