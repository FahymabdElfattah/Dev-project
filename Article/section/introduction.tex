\subsection*{Introduction}
Computer vision is a discipline that involves developing algorithms to enable computers to understand and interpret images and videos. However, these algorithms are often resource-intensive, particularly in terms of computational power and energy. This poses a problem for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, which have significant energy limitations.

Indeed, these devices have a limited battery that needs to power not only the main processor but also the camera and other sensors required for computer vision. Additionally, these devices need to be compact enough for easy portability, which limits the size of the battery and consequently the battery life.

That is why energy efficiency is a major concern in computer vision for mobile devices. Researchers are therefore working on developing techniques to reduce energy consumption while maintaining sufficient processing quality for the intended applications. These techniques can include algorithm optimization, reducing the number of steps in the pipeline, or utilizing specialized hardware to accelerate certain tasks.
